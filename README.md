Code excercises for those who are new to ruby and just need some practise.

Install the gems with bundler.

`bundle`

Run all the examples with rspec.

`rspec`

Run a single file at ones by passing the file name to the command.

`rspec getting_started/getting_started_spec.rb`

Run a single example by passing the line number if the corresponding 'it' block after the filename.

`rspec getting_started/getting_started_spec.rb:53`

Replace the __ with the correct values to make the tests pass.
